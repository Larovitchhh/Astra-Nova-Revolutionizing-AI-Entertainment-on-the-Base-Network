Astra Nova’s deployment on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 chain, enhances its scalability with low-cost, high-speed transactions, making it accessible to a broader audience. Base’s growth (6 million users and $1.3 billion in bridged assets by mid-2024) provides a robust platform for mass adoption. Additionally, its multi-chain approach, including Shibarium, diversifies risk and taps into varied Web3 communities. This infrastructure supports seamless gameplay and token interactions, critical for user retention.
